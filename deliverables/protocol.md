JOB STORIES
Story #1 

When I am navigating the UI, 

I want a colour filter to be applied, 

So it is easier to read the buttons and tasks, 

Because I have dyslexia. 

 

Story #2 

when I complete an action, 

I want immediate audio feedback on the task I am performing, 

So I am sure that the task has been completed, 

Because I am visually impaired. 

 

Story #3 

When I make an important task, 

I want to be able to mark it as ‘Important’, 

So I don’t lose them amongst the other tasks, 

Because I have loads of tasks. 

 

Story #4 

When I am deleting tasks, 

I want a conformation pop-up to show, 

So I don’t accidentally delete a task, 

Because I delete task a lot to get rid of them. 

You should have 3-6 stories in total. One story may inform more than one pilot study task. 

 

Story #5 

When I am trying to read the tasks, 

I want to be able to change the size of the font, 

So it is easier to read the tasks, 

Because I have poor eyesight.
